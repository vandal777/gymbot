# Gym Companion - Mobile Application

This is a mobile application developed with React Native that acts as your gym companion. It helps you track your progress, provides personalized workout routines, and keeps you motivated on your fitness journey.

## Merge Rules

To maintain the quality of the code and the stability of the project, we have implemented a merge rule. In order to merge any changes into the `master` branch, you must follow these steps:

1. Create a Pull Request (PR) with your changes.
2. Request a code review from one of the team members.
3. Your PR needs at least one approval from a reviewer before you can merge your changes into `master`.

This ensures that at least a second person has reviewed and approved the changes, which helps maintain the quality of the code and prevent the introduction of errors.
